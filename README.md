frontcast
=========

Mac & Unix installation

Note: we use '/path/to/' as base folder

Create your frontcast virtualenv:

	$ mkvirtualenv frontcast
	$ cd frontcast
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt

â€¦ and create the lacking folders (change permissions according to your system configuration)
	
	$ mkdir logs media locale sqlite
	

We added sqlite folder because we will use a sqlite db. Make sure that apache user has the right to write the .db parent folder.
